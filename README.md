# desktopRPG Rulebook: RWBY
> The Unofficial RWBY Tabletop RPG Rulebook Conversion

Within this repository you will find all the text from the RWBY Tabletop RPG rulebook formatted in Markdown. We've created this repo to prepare all the documents for integration within the desktopRPG engine. Feel free to make comments, pull requests, and issues on the `current` branch, as this will be the version we build our own flavor of the game off of. Otherwise all other branches are for archival purposes only.

See `LICENSE.md` for more information.
