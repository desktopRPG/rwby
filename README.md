# desktopRPG Rulebook: RWBY Update 6.29.17
> The Unofficial RWBY Tabletop RPG Rulebook Conversion

## Changelog (from the Reddit Post)

#### Chapters
"Playing the Game" and "Mastering the Game" have been changed to "Character Creation" and "Playing the Game" respectively.  
Character creation has been streamlined, most notably with the removal of the list of skill check descriptions and the addition of a quick reference table for the various combat uses for attributes.  
Playing the Game has been reorganized to present useful information for players before it presents information more useful for GMs.

#### Weapon Styles
"Weapon Variants" are now called "Weapon Styles." This vocabulary is much more accurate as to how a characters weapon affects the character.

*Exotic Weapon Mods* Added a short Example list.

#### New Grimm

Beringal, Nucklavee, Petra Gigas, Geist, and Elemental Templates have been added.  
Nucklaveee, Petra Gigas. and Geist are now under the "Exotic Enemy" section. This is really to separate them from the standard set of Grimm.

#### Swarms
Dust Effects now do proper damage against swarms.

#### Adventure
Section describing the GM's job has been moved to the Adventure section.

#### Glossary
Removed
