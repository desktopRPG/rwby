# Semblance

Semblance is the active manifestation of the Character’s soul. Every Huntsman and Huntress has a Semblance that is unique to them.

Semblance checks are always a WIL Check and one other attribute. This second attribute depends on how the Semblance is being utilized. When a Character decides how they wish to utilize their Semblance, the GM determines what the secondary attribute will be. This varies from use to use, but some Semblances can favor a particular attribute. Semblances last 1 turn, and characters can keep the effect up with a WIL+END check each turn.

#### Empower
Before rolling a Semblance Check a character may choose to Empower their Semblance by reducing their Aura by 1 point to temporarily increase the dice pool for that check by 1d10.

Semblances can also be used to make attacks. However, failing to bypass an enemy’s defenses with a Semblance roll reduces the character’s Aura by 1, and the attack fails. This is in addition to any damage they took from Empowering the Semblance.

### Example Semblances
The following are common Semblances
that are straight-forward and easily adapted
to most character concepts. This is not a list
of every semblance. These are just suggestions.
Semblances can be anything, so long as it follows
a singular concept. Anything that reasonably falls
within that Semblance’s realm can be attempted
with an Aura check.

#### Speed
The Character can move at blinding speeds to
the point where they briefly disappear, create
whirlwinds, or move across the surface of water,
even “fly”, but only when moving forward.

#### Glyphs
The Character can create Glyphs that can act as
solid objects, manipulate movement or perception
of time.

#### Clone
Semi-solid images of the character are conjured up
that can act and move as if it were the original to
distract enemies or shield allies.

#### Berserk
The physical capabilities of the Character increase
as they take additional damage.

#### Telekinesis
The Character can move objects with their mind.

#### Phase
The Character can dissolve their body into an
incorporeal substance to pass through tight spaces,
or solid objects. At very high levels, a Character
could even become invisible or immune to many
hazards.

#### Possession
This Semblance allows the Character to enter
into an unattended object or simple minded
animal, gaining a certain awareness of their target’s
physical or mental state.

#### Gravity
The Character can manipulate the mass of objects,
increasing and decreasing their effective weight.

#### Link
The Character can establish a personal link with a
single target, allowing the transmission of thought,
physical prowess, Aura and under incredible
circumstances, Semblance.

#### Teleport
By connecting two points in space, the Character
can instantly transport themselves or others short
distances.

#### Summon
The Character can call short lived phantasms and
homunculi that vaguely resemble a living creature
or robot into existence. These phantasms can
perform simple tasks and at higher levels they can
distract and attack enemies.

#### Construct
A character can craft simple objects out of
nothing. As Characters roll higher, the complexity
of the object increases.

#### Transform
The Character can modify parts of their own body
to temporarily give themselves bestial or demonic
traits.

#### Illusions
The Character can manipulate what other entities
around them see or hear, they can even remove
any trace of something that is actually there.
