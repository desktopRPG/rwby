# Base Attributes

Base Attributes are the primary definitions of a Character. By looking at their attributes one can see what they are good at and what they struggle with. Players Rank their six Attributes from 0 to 5. The attribute represented by 5 being their most adept. These numerical rankings are the number that is added to skill checks. Every Character is good at some things, but no one is good at everything.

#### Strength (STR):
Represents the Character’s ability to manipulate the world through physical effort. STR is primarily used in melee attack rolls for accuracy and damage. Any check that involves the Character trying to physically overpower an obstacle uses STR.

#### Agility (AGI):
Represents the Character’s ability to move quickly or precisely. AGI is primarily used for ranged weapon accuracy. Checks that require sudden and rapid movement or fine, precise movements use AGI.

#### Endurance (END):
Represents the Character’s stamina and durability. END primarily determines Health. Checks that involve withstanding a hazard or maintaining effort over a long period of time use END.

#### Perception (PER):
Represents the senses and the strength of a character’s Aura. PER is primarily used in defensive checks and determines the amount of Aura a character has. Checks that require a keen eye or the ability to pick up on hidden clues use PER.

#### Willpower (WIL):
Represents the Character’s ability to influence the world with their mind. WIL is used mostly for Semblance checks but can also be used for more conventional influence, such as lying or bribing. A Character’s WIL score also determines their Initiative in combat.

#### Discipline (DIS):
Represents the Character’s study and experience. DIS is primarily used to determine Capacity and Complexity of a Character’s weapon. DIS is used for all Dust checks to bend the substance to the Character’s desires. Checks that require a clear mind and controlled thoughts are DIS checks.
