# Derived Statistics
Derived Statistics are determined using the Base Attributes. They are fixed pools that slowly decrease as various actions are taken. Each Derived Statistic has a unique effect when its value reaches 0.

### Health
*END+1*  
Health is the amount of physical damage a Character can withstand before succumbing to their wounds. When Health reaches 0, the Character is knocked unconscious and left at the mercy of their enemies. Health is only recovered through medical attention.

### Aura
*PER+10*  
Aura is the physical manifestation of the soul. Every human and Faunas generates an Aura, and Huntsman and Huntresses have been trained in its use specifically. Aura is an extra layer of protection for its user and is depleted when attacks cannot be avoided. A Character can also attempt to influence the world around them with their Aura in the form of a Semblance. When Aura reaches 0, PER cannot be added to defensive rolls and Semblance uses cannot be attempted. Aura recharges 1 point every hour of non-strenuous action, and fully recharges after a full night’s rest.

### Capacity
*DIS+1*  
Capacity is the amount of ammunition and Dust a Huntsman’s or Huntress’ weapon can hold. Using Ranged attacks or Dust depletes Capacity. Characters are considered to have an infinite amount of ammunition on their person, but a finite amount of ammunition is in a given magazine. If a Character possesses Dust, only one color can be declared per reload. A Character may choose to use normal ammunition instead of the currently equipped Dust. When Capacity reaches 0, the character cannot use ranged attacks or Dust. Capacity is completely refilled anytime the character spends an action to reload.
