# Weapon Modifications

DIS represents the time and effort the character has put into their weapon and training. For every point in DIS, a character may add a level of complexity to their weapon in the form of a weapon modification. While many modifications can be added to the weapon, some apply directly to the character. Players and GMs are encouraged to create or change Weapon Modifications in order to generate a unique character. For example: a character wants to use two weapons but does not want the extra attacks associated with it. They do not need to spend the extra DIS to gain a modification they do not want. Players need to explain to their GM how their weapon design works. For instance: Additional Weapon can be selected multiple times, but it is on the player to explain how 3 or more weapons can be wielded. Some Modifications are infinitely stacking, and can be taken as many times as desired, with the effects combining additively.

### Static Weapons
Characters with a DIS of 0 may choose to forgo the melee or ranged form of their signature weapon to gain a weapon modification or Dust. Only characters with DIS of 0 may make this choice. Characters who forgo their ranged weapon cannot make ranged attacks, and characters who forgo their melee weapon may still make melee attacks, but are treated as if they were unarmed.


### List of modifications

***Additional Weapon***  
*Effect*: Characters may make 1 bonus attack per level of Additional Weapon modification they possess during any turn they make at least 1 normal attack. These bonus attacks add STR to Melee attacks and AGI to Ranged attacks, but no secondary attributes. Bonus attacks add no attributes to damage.  
*Description*: Characters wield multiple weapons or have a fighting style that gives them a great number of attacks.  
*Special*: This modification may be taken any number of times. Each level grants an additional free attack.

***Alternate Form***  
*Effect*: The Character selects an additional melee or ranged Style for their base weapon. When using this alternate form, they receive a damage bonus equal to the accuracy penalty compared to their primary weapon form. Example: A character with a +9 Aggressive weapon chooses a +5 Elegant weapon as their Alternate Form. When using this Elegant weapon, they receive a damage bonus of +4. This bonus does not carry over between ranged and melee forms.  
*Description*: By holding back and using their weapon in a sub-optimal form, such as a great-sword rather than a scythe, the character is able to deal significantly more damage.  
*Special*: Characters can select this modification multiple times, selecting an additional weapon Style for every instance they do so.

***Armor***  
*Effect*: Increase Health by 1. Description: Either worn heavy armor or a trained physical toughness makes the character slightly more durable than normal.

***Dust Infused Clothing***  
*Effect*: A Character may select 1 color of Dust they already possess. This specific type of Dust may be used even when the Character is without their weapon. The character may apply the Crystal Dust effect of their chosen color on any unarmed melee attacks at the cost of 1 Capacity. Characters may make Energy (AGI+WIL) ranged attacks while unarmed, but it must always be the Dust Round effect, costing 2 capacity and dealing half damage. Dust Phials may be used normally when unarmed.  
*Description*: An archaic means of utilizing Dust, the Character has woven a color of the substance into their clothing, providing its benefits even when unarmed.

***Extended Magazine***  
*Effect*: Increase Capacity by 5.  
*Description*: The Character’s magazine capacity is significantly increased through either smaller ammunition or oversized loading mechanisms.  
*Special*: This modification may be taken any number of times, each level granting an additional 5 capacity.

***Hands Free***  
*Effect*: Weapon can be used without holding it.  
*Description*: The weapon can be used while the Character’s hands are otherwise occupied. Usually, but not always, the weapon must be attached to the Character in some way.

***Hooked***  
*Effect*: Effectively grab objects, terrain, or enemies with the weapon. Use melee attack attributes for all Grapple Checks.  
*Description*: The weapon is shaped in such a way that it can effectively hold various things. Weapons such a scythes and whips can be considered “Hooked”.  
*Special*: Hooked can be selected twice. The second version of Hooked gives the character a grappling hook. This grappling hook allows them to make a STR+PER Grapple checks up to a distance of 50ft.

***Martial Arts***  
*Effect*: Unarmed strikes deal full damage.  
*Description*: Through rigorous training without their weapon, a Character is adept at doing damage with their bare hands. The normal damage penalty for unarmed strikes does not apply. Additionally, an unarmed strike can be of any melee weapon Style, but this Style cannot be changed.

***Mixed Capacity***  
*Effect*: Declare an additional Color of Dust.  
*Description*: During every reload, the Character declares two Colors of Dust they possess instead of one. All Capacity uses with Mixed Capacity can be either of the two declared Colors, but never both at the same time.  
*Special*: This modification may be taken any number of times, each level grants an additional Color that may be declared every action.

***Mobility***  
*Effect*: The Character moves 20ft with each action. When using their entire turn on movement, a Character can travel 75ft instead of 50. Also movement Capacity Boosts move the Character 10ft instead of 5.  
*Description*: The Character’s weapon includes a means of movement with a small personal vehicle, such as hoverboard or skates. This modification only affects the Character who wields the weapon.

***Reach***  
*Effect*: Extended melee range. (+5ft on a battle grid).  
*Description*: The weapon is extremely long and the Character does not need to be adjacent to their target. Almost all pole arms, and even some swords have reach. Weapons at the end of whip-like structures have Reach as well.

***Shield***  
*Effect*: Use Resistance, END+PER to block attacks for nearby allies.  
*Description*: A weapon that includes a shield of some kind that can deflect damage for adjacent allies. Failed checks result in damage being dealt to both the Character using Shield, and to the Character being protected. Only the Character with Shield may take the damage reduction for failed END checks, the other Character must take the full damage.

### Exotic Modifications
Some players will want to craft Characters that are simply not possible under the presented system. A simple way to further customize characters is to allow them to spend a point of Discipline on other abilities that are not specifically tied to the weapon.

### Additional Damage
**Incendiary Crystals/Bleed Rounds** Apply additional damage to the target equal to the total number of damage dice being rolled for the attack. Example: 1d6+1, 3d6+3.

### Splash Damage
**Explosive Rounds/Arc Crystals** For every damage die being rolled against the primary target, deal a point of damage to adjacent enemies. Example 1d6=1, 3d6=3

### Overpenetration
**Armor-Piercing Rounds** can over penetrate a target. When an attack with Armor-Piercing Rounds successfully hits the target, any enemy standing directly behind the target is treated as if it was attacked by the same attack roll. This second enemy compares its Defense Threshold to the attack as normal.

### Status Effects
**Fissure Crystals/Equilibrium Rounds/Stun Rounds/Rust Crystals/Scream Crystals/ Chill Rounds/Flare Rounds** Some Dust effects emulate the Status Effects presented later on page 26.  
Status Effects caused by Dust are wiped away and replaced if any new Status Effect is also caused by Dust.  
All effects from Dust last no longer than 1 round.
