# Weapon Design

Every Character begins with a weapon. Most Huntsmen and Huntresses forge their own Weapons while some inherit them from family. Huntsmen and Huntresses spend almost their entire lives training with their signature weapon, to the point where it is no longer a tool but an extension of themselves. When using anything besides their signature weapon, including being unarmed, a character’s damage is cut in half (rounding down).

There are three Styles of melee weapons and three Styles of ranged weapons. The chosen Style is decided at the beginning of weapon design and cannot be changed. None of these classifications are clearly defined, with many weapons relying more on how the weapon is wielded rather than what it is. Each Style relies on different base attributes to determine accuracy.

Every character begins with a weapon that has both melee and ranged forms.

All weapon damage is equalized at 1d6 regardless of the base weapon.

All Melee weapons can only be used against adjacent enemies, but add the character’s STR score to total damage rolled.

All Ranged weapons have a max range of 100ft, and add no attribute to damage.


### Melee Styles

*Aggressive- STR+END*  
These weapons are designed to be wielded in two hands even if the character does not do so. Most bludgeoning weapons such as hammers, and shields fall under this Style, as do overly large claymores and scythes. Unarmed attacks and worn weapons such as gauntlets or boots are also Aggressive weapons.

*Precise- STR+AGI*  
Small weapons, wielded in one hand, and usually exceptionally small or thin. Daggers, rapiers or claw-like weapons usually fall under this Style.

*Elegant- STR+DIS*  
Most Melee weapons fall under the Elegant Style. Elegant weapons are any variety that use specialized training to use. Straight swords, whip-like weapons and staves rely more on careful training than physical prowess. Weapons with capacity for Dust are typically Elegant, but are not limited to this single Style.


### Ranged Styles

*Heavy- AGI+END*  
Heavy weapons are large or unwieldy, requiring a great deal of strength to use effectively. Heavy machine guns, shotguns, explosive launchers, and bows are all heavy weapons.

*Energy- AGI+WIL*  
Energy weapons deal damage with bolts of pure energy, or by tapping into the Characters Semblance. These bolts are directed with force of will, bending and writhing toward the target, but cannot reach that which the wielder cannot see.

*Accurate- AGI+DIS*  
Accurate ranged weapons are best used when carefully aimed. Pistols, assault rifles, and sniper rifles fall squarely in this category. Most conventional firearms are Accurate weapons.
