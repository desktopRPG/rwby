# Game Mastering

Game Mastering is a daunting, but very important job. Without the Game Master, no game would be Possible. The GM’s primary role in any given roll is to follow the logic of events and explain the consequences of the players’ actions, GM’s are the ultimate law of the game, they are the window into Remnant for their player, set the conflict, play every villain, and every friend. It is a huge undertaking, but ultimately rewarding. The most important thing to remember about Game Mastering in general, is that everyone is there to have fun, GMs and Players alike. If the game is fun, and has people asking “when is the next game?”, then the Game Master has succeeded. Even though the GM sets obstacles in the path of their players, the GM is never their enemy. Game Masters have ultimate control over the game and the rules. A great deal of these rules rely on a Game Master’s digression, especially RoC, the cornerstone of the Unofficial RWBY Tabletop RPG.

# Adventure Hooks
Adventure hooks are means to draw players into a story, hint at danger and subsequent reward. Some adventure hooks ask a question, some are rumors, some are designated missions.

- A Blue Dust mine has exploded for no apparent reason.
- A huge surge of Grimm have been recorded on the walls of Vale.
- The Vytal festival is a month away.
- A teacher at Beacon is missing.
- An Atlesian airship has crashed in the desert and no one is on board.
- Elder Grimm have all but disappeared.
- A string of robberies have been taking all the Dust from local stores, and leaving all the money.
- A submarine with markings of the White Fang washes up on shore, its hull torn asunder.
- Someone is selling an exotic form of dust that is being used as a very dangerous recreational drug.
- A White Fang hideout is rumored to be somewhere in the south east.

# Story
Cooperatively telling a story is a major aspect of playing a tabletop role-playing game. It is the GM’s responsibility to present the story, and the player’s responsibility to drive it forward. The story can be anything from a simple as extermination of Grimm to a complex political game involving the council, backroom deals and mysterious benefactors. GMs should have a story in mind when first building a team of players, and also be prepared for players to take an entirely different path than expected.

# Beyond Remnant
The RoC system is meant to a recreation of elaborate action scenes and reward player creativity in a simple and easy to pick up manner. These concepts are not limited to Remnant and The world of RWBY. Characters could just as easily be superheroes inspired by comic books, or soldiers in power armor during an alien invasion, mech pilots on the frontier of space, or even the generic medieval fantasy that was the origin of tabletops in general. Any story a GM wants to tell, any land players wish to live in, Remnant is only the beginning of the worlds to be explored.
