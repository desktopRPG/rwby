# Exterior Map

**A) Doors**. These two sliding Bay doors are currently closed, but two Man doors cut into each is open. In front of the doors stands two Fighters and four Thugs. The Fighters act as Bouncers and actually talk to newcomers, the Thugs are just extra muscle. To enter the club through normal means is a WIL+DIS check of 10 for a “cover charge”. Connects to A1.

**B) Fire Escape**. A set of metal walkways that rise from the alley on the left side to the Club to the roof. The second floor of the fire escape leads to a locked emergency exit that connects to B2.

**C) Windows**. Two small windows in the alley way on the right hand side. Connect to C1.

**D) Gang Lounge door**. Locked door with a sliding eye slot. An Intimidate, Influence, or Bribery Check of 15 opens the door. Connects to H1.

**E) Dumpsters**. Filled with garbage and debris.

**F) Four large air conditioning units** sit at each corner of the warehouse room. Each stands approximately 10ft tall and makes enough noise to cover normal speaking conversation.

**G) Roof Access**. Standing in front of the door is a Fighter and a Soldier. Connects to F2.

**H) A long, angled skylight** stands in the middle of the warehouse roof. Its glass is an opaque red that pulses with the lights of the dance floor, but otherwise block all vision.
