# Inside

Inside the club is a large raised dance floor brightly lit from below with four purely aesthetic glass pillars at each corner. Against the wall directly opposite the door is a Bar with a bear helmeted DJ above. To the left is a stage, and to the right is a staircase that rises onto a balcony that runs the perimeter of the interior. Everything is dark with flashing strobes of red and white.

**A1) Doors**.  
**B1) Private Booths**. A quieter corner of the Club fill with a handful of couples being “close”. 1 Thug stands nearby.  
**C1) Bathrooms**. Three stalls on the left, three sinks on the right, a window in the center facing the door. Both bathrooms have identical layouts. The Men’s restroom has a Fighter in it. The women’s has two civilians.  
**D1) Stage**. Currently empty and being used as a projection screen for visuals of the dance music.  
**E1) Dance floor**. A raised platform lit from below and filled with a dancing crowd. The music is loudest here. Directly overhead is a quickly spinning circle of hanging lights.  
**F1) Storage**. Quiet and mostly filled with extra liquor and a small collection of cleaning supplies.  
**G1) Armory**. Filled with legal surplus guns for Juniors gang. If a fight breaks out on the dance floor, nearby Thugs will rush this room and their attacks will become ranged.  
**H1) Gang Lounge**. A private back room with a card table and a small bar. There are three Soldiers and two Thugs in this room.  
**I1) Bar**. Two Soldiers stand behind the long, well stocked bar.

**A2) VIP lounge**. A Soldier, a Fighter, and a velvet rope divide this area from the rest of the Club. Lorenzo Chalk and the Malachite Twins sit on a sofa. The Malachite twins each hold one of the key cards necessary to use the Service Elevator.  
**B2) Junior’s Office**. Every door to Juniors office is locked behind a 20 Lock picking or Break check. The room has dark wallpaper and maroon carpet. The music is almost completely inaudible from inside. Along a wall overlooking the dance floor is a one way mirror. Inside the office is a desk with a computer and a picture frame. Inside the desk is a large collection of files of the legal operations of the Club. Junior’s Computer can be accessed with a Hacking check of 15. This will reveal a series of emails with an unnamed benefactor who has recently delivered “Stock” to Junior. The Benefactor only puts their name down as “C”.  
**C2) Service elevator**. Locked with two key cards. Cannot be picked or locked in any reasonable fashion. It is loud and slow, and any use of it is obvious to everyone in the club. Does not stop on the ground floor. Connects to A3.  
**D2) DJ Booth**. Sitting in front of a turn table is a Soldier wearing a large spherical bear shaped helmet. The DJ also has basic control of the lights on the dance floor and stage.  
**E2) Security**. Locked behind a single door that requires at least a 15 Lock picking or Break check. There are two Fighters in this room looking at security feeds from the Bar, the VIP lounge, Dance Floor, Stage, and Loading Dock. The Loading Dock screen shows a shipping container being loaded in by four AK-130 robots and Junior.  
**F2) Roof Access**.

# Interior Map, Basement

The Basement of Junior’s Club is much smaller than the warehouse above it. One wall is almost completely devoted to a Loading Dock that has been closed by a large rolling door. Storage crates line the back wall. A Shipping container is in in the center of the room partially blocking the door, a large hole punched in the side of it. Four destroyed AK-130 Droids are lying in heaps around the container. A very nice black car is also parked in here but is blocked from leaving by the shipping container. The Car is currently being assaulted by an Ursa Major.

**A3) Service Elevator**.  
**B3) Loading Dock**. A large rolling door that has been shut. Attempting to open it reveals it has been locked from the outside with heavy chains.  
**C3) Shipping Container**. On the side of the Shipping container is a large hole ripped from the inside.  
**D3) Junior’s Car**. Junior sits inside cowering from the Ursa Major that is attacking it.  

# The Backdoor

If the Characters decide to explore the surrounding buildings, they can discover the shipping container in the basement of a parking garage before even entering Junior’s Club. In this case the AK-130 droids are still active, the Ursa loses its major template, and Junior is upstairs with Chalk and the Malachite twins. In essence the encounter moves backwards. In this case Junior has the same stats as a Major Ursa, with ranged attacks instead of the Ursa’s special ability.
