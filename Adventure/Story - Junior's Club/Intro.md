# Junior's Club

Near the docks and under a freeway is a repurposed warehouse filled with noise and people. The characters have been tasked by Vale Police Department to investigate one of Junior’s nightclubs as there is supposed to be a shipment of weapons coming in tonight.

The building is approximately 100ft square, 50ft tall and made of steel. It is flanked by identical warehouses on either side and a parking garage from behind. A 10ft alley separates it from all adjacent buildings. A large and noisy crowd gathers in the front behind velvet ropes. Along the side a fire escape rises about halfway down the left side alley. Junior’s gang is distinguishable from civilians with their telltale red ties, glasses, and fine black suits.
