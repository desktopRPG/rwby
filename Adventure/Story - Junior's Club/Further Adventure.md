# Questions, Secrets, and Further Adventure

Questioning Junior after the defeat of the Ursa will reveal he was receiving what he thought was a shipment of weapons from his business associate, Lorenzo Chalk. This raises several questions and how the adventure continues is determined by how the GM answers those questions.

Lorenzo Chalk could be trying to destroy Junior’s Gang as an act of revenge. Characters can retrace Chalk’s steps to find out where he acquired an Ursa, and what past event was he trying to pay back.

Chalk is being set up by the White Fang. He intended on delivering several thousand Lien worth of weapons to Junior. Similar questions are raised as above with the major characters changing roles.
