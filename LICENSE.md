This repository was created to prepare the Unofficial RWBY Tabletop RPG rulebook
for integration into the desktopRPG engine. It also serves a second-purpose as
being a place for the community to comment and build upon the text of the
rulebook.

We may make minor editorial changes to the archival branches (such as grammar
and punctuation).

Certain branches of this repository may be used to make major modifications to
the rulebook, and as such, WILL NOT be deemed archival. They may contain text
that is from the original, but modifications will by licensed by License 2
below. For information on which branches will be archival, see the `README.md`.
