# Humans

Compared to Grimm and Robotic Enemies, humans are fairly weak. There isn’t a great deal of variety in possible human opponents that a Huntsman and Huntress will come in conflict with, and usually a large group of them is necessary to pose noticeable threat. Generally human opponents are members of a street gang, the White Fang, or the military. Faunas are interchangeable with all Human enemies. When a human’s health is reduced to 0 they are knocked unconscious and rendered Helpless.
