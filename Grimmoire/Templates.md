# Elemental Templates
The following templates are to add Dust elemental effects to various types of Grimm that have improvements and drawbacks and do not increase the threat level, but do slightly increase the deadliness of the creatures. These templates replace the existing Special abilities of the Grimm that they are added to.

All elemental templates are immune to the Dust effects of the same color.

***Red- Fire*** Special Ability: Passive. When a Fire Grimm dies, it explodes and deals 1 point of damage to all Characters that are adjacent to it. The Fire Grimm can also choose to detonate prematurely using its full attack and damage values.  
***Yellow- Earth*** Special Ability: 2 actions. The Earth Grimm encases itself in rock, becoming nearly impervious to damage until it’s next turn. the Earth Grimm increases its defense by 5 points until the beginning of its next turn.  
***Green- Wind*** Special Ability: Passive. A Wind Grimm gains the ability to fly and its movement speed is doubled.  
***Blue- Water*** Special Ability: 1 action. A Water Grimm shoots a stream of highly pressurized water out of its mouth at its target. This attack has a threshold of (-5 of normal attack.) and does normal damage. This attack has a range of 50ft and pushes characters hit by it 5ft/damage back.
