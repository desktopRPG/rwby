# Robots

Robots on Remnant are synthetic entities typically used for security. Both private companies and the military make extensive use of automations. Robots typically have standing orders such as “Protect the area”, “Destroy Target”, but can also be remotely controlled. Some piloted vehicles are also considered robotic enemies if the the pilot is completely encased in the vehicle. All robots are made of synthetic materials like metals and ceramics and are generally more resilient than humans or Grimm of similar threat levels. When a robot’s health is reduced to 0 it is destroyed, but can be repaired given enough time and proper skill.
