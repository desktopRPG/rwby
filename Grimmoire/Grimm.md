# Grimm

Grimm are the greatest persistent threat to every person on Remnant. They are drawn towards large concentrations of negative feelings and energy. Generally Grimm have little more than a rudimentary instinctual intelligence, but as they age they can learn and grow significantly. Grimm all have crimson eyes, and pitch black fur or scales. Older Grimm have large plates of white bone armor etched with red streaks from the head down. When a Grimm’s health is reduced to 0 it immediately begins to evaporate into a black mist that quickly dissipates.
