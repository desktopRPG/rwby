# Grimmoire

Enemies are any entity that is opposed to the Characters and has a degree of intelligence. Enemies come in three basic types, Grimm, Robots, and Humans. There are also Rivals, who are enemies that possess some degree of training as a Huntsman or Huntress; and Swarms which are large groups of easily dispatched enemies. Enemies have the use a similar action budget as Characters: three total actions, no more than two of which can be attacks. Special Abilities consume the attack actions first. Enemy movement is 15ft per action and 50ft if only using movement actions, unless otherwise noted.

Every aspect of Enemies is a fixed number that players roll against. Players rolling attacks against Enemies are awarded bonuses upon defeating the monster’s defense threshold by a given threshold. All bonuses for defeating an Enemy’s defenses stack.

### Defense Thresholds
** [+5] Bonus Damage** varies by enemy type, this is added on top of the natural damage from the base 1d6 and any RoC bonus damage.  
** [+10] Maximize Damage** treats all damage dice
that would be rolled, including Bonus Dice from
defeating a defense by 5, automatically as a 6.  
** [+10] Collateral Damage** deals damage to all enemies
adjacent to the primary target with a defense lower
than the primary target. When bypassing an Enemies Defense by 10, the
player chooses whether to deal Maximized or
Collateral damage.  
** [+15] Instantly Kill Target** immediately reduces its Health to 0.  
** [+20] Kill Multiple Targets** immediately reduces the health all enemies adjacent to the target that have a defense equal to or lower than the target’s defense to 0.


###  Enemy Health Pools
Add the health pools of all enemies in an intended encounter. This total correlates with a how difficult a fight will be. Typically an encounter should last at least 5 turns of full combat. Given the nature of RoC, these numbers can fluctuate significantly, but this is usually a suitable starting point.

**Easy**: Less than 100 health  
**Medium**: Between 100-200 health  
**Hard**: Over 200 Health

## How to Read Descriptions
**Description**: A short physical description of the enemy in question.  
**Health**: How much damage an enemy can withstand before being defeated, killed, or destroyed.  
**First Turn**: Enemies act as if this number is their WIL score to determine turn order. This number is represented as ½ numbers so they never occupy the same Turn Phase as player Characters. On the First Turn, no Enemy of a given variety can act before this point. Following the first turn, Enemies are placed in the turn order as evenly between the players’ turn order as possible.  
**Attack**: Threshold characters must beat with a Defensive Aura check to escape unscathed. Melee attacks can only be made to adjacent characters, ranged attacks can be made to attack anyone within 100ft. The source of the damage is noted in each attack.  
**Damage**: How much damage is dealt to players when they fail a defensive check.  
**Defense**: Threshold characters must surpass with an attack roll to begin dealing damage.  
**Bonus**: Extra damage awarded for defeating a creature’s defenses by 5 or more.  
**Special**: Additional action the enemy can perform, consuming one or two actions during its turn. Certain enemies can have a Passive ability that is always active, and never needs to be used as part of a turn. Some special abilities are Special attacks that function as an attack with a defense threshold and damage.  
**Threat**: A general guideline of how much RoC is necessary to defeat the enemy in question.
