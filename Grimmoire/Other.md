# Exotic Enemy

Use of Exotic Enemies should be reserved for set
piece encounters or the culmination of an
adventure. They are “Boss” battles that have
multiple phases, invulnerability mechanics, or numerous
special abilities. The examples given here
are Grimm, but Robotic and Human Exotic enemies
are just as common. There is often a great
deal of overlap between Rivals and Exotic Enemies.

### Nucklavee
**Description**: A truly terrifying creature, the Nucklaveee is extremely rare and dangerous. Few have seen a Nucklavee and those who have are often unable to face one again. It has the appearance of a massive skeletal humanoid atop a horse, but is really one creature. The Nucklavee is about 20 feet tall from head to toe and every movement it’s humanoid form makes makes is a sudden twitch. Because of it’s size the Nucklavee has a movement speed of 50 feet per action.

# Swarms
Swarms are for any encounter that calls for an unorthodox number of combatants. A Swarm is numerous, and has as many entities in it as it has health, but act as a single enemy. Characters will defeat multiple members of a swarm in a single attack. Swarms lack a special ability, and instead simply act between every player character, effectively 4 times a turn. Swarms can be of any enemy type, not simply the example given. Swarms of Humans and Robots are also possible, but are less common. Typically any creature in a swarm is of a weaker and less threatening variety than its full grown/trained counterpart. Swarms are incapable of ranged attacks. Dust Effects with Over-penetration and Splash Damage deal Additional Damage instead.
