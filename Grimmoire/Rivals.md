# Rivals

Rivals are any enemy that has similar capabilities as a Character trained as a Huntsman or Huntress. They are almost always Human or Faunas, but extremely advanced robots or even exotic varieties of Grimm can rival a Character. Rivals are exemplified by very high damage and very low health pools, thus conflict with them tends to be very quick and costly. Not limited to being a Mastermind, Evil-doer, or Bad guy, but can be a mercenary, tournament opponent, or simply another hero on similar but conflicting quest. Fights with rivals are tailored to a given adventure and the examples below are simply generic stat blocks.
