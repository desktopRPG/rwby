# Dust Shards

Dust Shards are a naturally occurring form of Dust that can be found and used by Huntsmen and Huntresses. Dust Shards are most commonly found in Red, Yellow, Green and Blue colors, but all types are possible. Dust Shards imbue a temporary elemental effect into any weapon they come in contact with. Weapons affected by dust shards exhibit the same Crystal and Round effects as if the character had selected the same color of dust during weapon design. Dust Shards can also be used as a short lived focusing agent for Phial like effects. All Dust Shards come at a maximum of 5 capacity. Upon consuming all the Capacity of a Shard, it becomes inert and useless. Shards may be used by any character regardless of their existing Dust selections. Characters may not take Dust Shards as part of weapon design.
