# Dust
Dust is “a naturally occurring energy propellant that can be triggered by the aura of humans and faunas.” Dust is energy in physical form, each color representing a different fundamental force of nature. Dust is naturally found in four base colors: Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. The six combinations of these Dusts create the 10 common colors available to characters.

In Remnant, many facets of everyday life are powered by Dust. Yellow Dust can be found running trains, Orange and Red Dust powering automobiles, and Green and Violet Dust in airships.

Dust comes in ten common colors with three forms for each color. Each color represents an aspect of nature that can be tapped into and each form is the method through which that element can be controlled.

Huntsmen and Huntresses encounter Dust most often in three forms: Crystals, Rounds and Phials. Crystals and Rounds impart their elemental aspect into targets they strike. Crystals are integrated into melee weapons. Rounds are elemental ammunition fired from a character’s ranged weapon.

Phials are Dust in a raw, primal state. Phials are cast into the air and attune the immediate area to the Dust’s color element. Phials are significantly more complicated to understand, but for characters willing to put in the effort, are significantly more versatile than Rounds and Crystals.

When using Phials, a character selects what aspect of the Dust they wish to control, and using a DIS roll as a base, the GM decides how those effects are manifested in the world. The second Attribute associated with the Dust Check depends on the color of the specific Dust.

Characters may choose one color of Dust in place of a modification, and have all three forms of that dust available to them. Every time the character reloads, they declare a single color of Dust they possess.

When using a Dust effect, Capacity is consumed regardless of whether the attack or action succeeds or fails.

Direct attacks using Dust phials consume two Capacity and both attack actions. Dust Phials have a maximum range equal to the DIS roll used for the Dust. Dust Phials cannot be used when a character is without their weapon.

Characters cannot “trade” dust with each other or NPCs. Each weapon is designed to use only the selected colors of Dust, and additional Dust colors can only be used if the Characters are presented the opportunity to redesign their weapons or the GM offers an additional Dust type as a story reward.

### Dust Infused Semblances
Characters can choose to influence their Semblance with the elemental effects of Dust. However, given the nature of Semblances, these infusions have no concrete effect, and vary wildly from instance to instance.

To infuse their Semblance with Dust, Characters must have the desired Color of Dust equipped. If a Character has multiple Dust Colors equipped at once through the use of Mixed Capacity, only one may be selected. Infusing a Semblance with Dust Consumes up to 5 capacity depending on the intended effect. The effect fails if the Character has insufficient capacity.

Ultimately the effect is dictated by the GM.
