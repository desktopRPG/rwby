# Combat

Huntsman and Huntresses come in conflict with Grimm by the very nature of their profession. Being combat ready is not just the norm, but it is expected. It is a rare to see pacifists seek this line of work.

In the RoC System, all obstacles Characters must overcome are set values, including enemy defenses, attacks and damages. As with every skill check in the game, Enemy attack and defense thresholds come in increments of 5.

With RoC, Characters will “outgrow” most adversaries. As numbers are rolled higher against enemies, it becomes easier to dispatch them. Against defenses this is demonstrated with passively dealing more damage at higher rolls as well as imparting detrimental status effects to enemies. Against attacks, players avoid weaker entities with ease and will have more opportunities to destroy them.

### Defensive Rolls
Any time the Characters come to a hazard that can do them harm, whether it be an entity actively trying to attack them or simply a part of the world that carries no particular malice. In such scenarios characters roll a Defense Check. Defense checks are one of five different rolls, and which attribute is rolled is dependent on how the character chooses to overcome the obstacle. Different defensive checks have different effects depending on which one is used and the outcome of the roll. Characters can generate RoC with a clever defensive action.

***Parry- STR+PER***  
Preempting the strike, and redirecting the damage elsewhere. Melee attacks and most physical hazards like falling boulders can be parried, but ranged attacks and incorporeal hazards like explosions cannot. When a Character successfully parries an attack, they immediately do 3 points of damage.

***Dodge- AGI+PER***  
Moving out of the way as quickly as possible. Almost all attacks and hazards can be avoided by dodging except in special cases such as poison gas. Successfully dodging a hazard allows the character to immediately move up to 15ft away, or any action that does not require a roll.

***Resist- END+PER***  
Reliance on the durability of the body to absorb any ill effects. Characters can attempt to resist any hazard regardless of source. If a character does not succeed at making a resist defensive check, they may choose to take 1 point of damage to Health rather than the normal damage to Aura.

***Semblance- WIL+PER***  
Semblances can be used to avoid damage, but which attack and hazards can be avoided are based on how the Semblance is used. The Character must have at least 1 point of Aura to make this check. When successfully using a defensive Semblance check, the Semblance is manifested as normal.

***Dust- DIS+PER***  
Dust Phial effects can be used to avoid damage, but which attack and hazards can be avoided are based on how the Dust is used. When successfully using a defensive Dust check, the Dust effect is manifested as normal. The Character consumes 1 Capacity to make this check.

Characters who avoid an attack by 5 or more may make a counter attack as their reaction instead of the normal bonus for avoiding the attack. They may also choose to perform any sufficiently complex task that requires a roll or a simple action, but only characters who Dodge can move with this action. Characters may at any time choose to do nothing with their reaction.
