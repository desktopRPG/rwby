# Variant Rules

Every rule in this book can be thrown out and replaced, every GM can build the game as they see fit. The following are simply guidelines on how to change the game and the possible consequences of those changes.

### Adrenaline Rush
As a Variant to the standard mechanics of RoC, Adrenaline Rush gives players a greater degree of agency over the effects of RoC on their game. Under the Adrenaline Rush Variant, players receive the bonus 1d10 from a creative or cinematic solution immediately, applying it to their actions for the turn right away. If they succeed in these actions, the d10 remains in effect until the start of their next turn, but disappears if they do not achieve their goal with the bonus die. This effect stacks up to three times, each additional die expiring exactly one turn from when it was awarded regardless of additional RoC bonuses. This Variant makes RoC management a bit of a metagame on its own, with players being given a deadline of exactly 1 turn to accomplish anything at a given power level.

### Alternate Attribute Generation
The given system of ranking attributes from 5 to 0 starts all Characters at the same level, and forces every player to make tough decisions regarding their skills. Other forms of attribute generation can make these attributes more or less extreme.

**Variant**: Roll 1d6-1 six times. This can give a completely randomized array between 0-5.

**Variant**: Divide 15 points between the 6 attributes. Attributes can be made no higher than 5 or lower than 0. This tends to create more extreme characters with little middle ground.

### Making Heritage Matter
Characters hail from all corners of Remnant. Depending on their personal history and heritage, characters can gain boosts that are not normally represented in the mechanics of the game.

**Variant**: Characters declare one of six heritages that they have. These boosts do not stack, even if a character associates with multiple in their personal history. Each heritage boosts a given attribute by 1 point. This does, however, incentivize players to build certain play styles into certain histories.

*Atlas*: Characters receive rigid military training, increasing their natural Strength by 1.

*Vacuo*: These Characters are rugged individualists, and are used to their native landâ€™s harsh climate, increasing their Endurance by 1.

*Mistral*: Mistral is known for its massive universities and libraries. Characters from Mistral are often very educated and naturally have a large breadth of knowledge, increasing their Discipline by 1.

*Vale*: Vale lies in the center of the four kingdoms, and those who have lived their whole life in its borders are well versed in the ability to influence others, increasing their Willpower by 1.

*Wilds*: Two kinds of people are in the Wilds between the Kingdoms, the quick and the dead. Characters need to be quick because they are well within the food chain, increasing their Agility by 1.

*Faunas*: Characters with any Faunas blood have heightened senses regardless of the Kingdom they hail from. They have an acute sense of smell and their acclaimed night vision, increasing their Perception by 1. This replaces the night vision mechanic in the core game.

### Character Progression
Characters in the base RoC system do not level up, as they are very powerful out of the gate, and the primary drive to overcome obstacles is creative thinking and generation of RoC. However some players will be looking to play the long game and would want a means to represent their previous experiences.
