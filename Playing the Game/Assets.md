# Assets

Assets are a means for Characters to have progression that lasts between sessions. Assets are presented to characters after a major combat encounter, such as after fighting a difficult Enemy Rival or a major plot development. Every Character may possess multiple assets. Some assets have similar functions to weapon modifications or Dust, but have unique properties or mechanics that make them incompatible with standard character creation. Assets are not always objects, and can instead be a more abstract concept like favors.

### Examples

**Sentry Turret**  
Once in an encounter a single Character may place an automated sentry turret that acts on their turn. The Turret cannot move, but draws attention to itself as if it were a character. The Character who placed the Turret rolls its attack and defense checks, using its attributes rather than their own. The turret has no Aura, and can only roll the single given bonus to defense. When Turret is destroyed it cannot be used again until making a AGI+DIS repair check of 25.  
*Health*: 5  
*Attack*: Machine Gun, +7  
*Defense*: Armor, +4

**Whisper Rounds**  
A Character may select to use Whisper Rounds in place of Dust when they reload. Characters that already have Pink Dust equipped may choose to utilize Whisper Rounds at any time, but the effects do not stack concurrently with Echo Rounds. Whisper Rounds make no discernable sound outside of a radius of 50ft around the shooter.

**DJ Helmet**  
A large and top heavy helmet worn by Juniorâ€™s DJ. This helmet is almost two feet in diameter and resembles the head of a teddy bear. While wearing the helmet, Characters are completely unaffected by all sonic attacks and Pink Dust effects, but their PER is treated as 0 for all non-defensive skill checks.
