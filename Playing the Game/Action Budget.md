# Action Budget

Players are not given a hard number of actions in a turn. Instead they have an “Action Budget”. The Action Budget is used all at once by players describing their actions for a turn. The limit on the number of actions is generally 3. This number can fluctuate based on the complexity of the tasks, level of RoC, or any number of situational modifiers, but 3 is usually appropriate.

Players who declare “I hit it with my axe” for their turn, only perform a single action, the remainder are lost, meanwhile, players who declare, “I run along the branches, dive on top of the Beowolf and stab him in the back,” has almost entirely filled their action budget, losing any remainder. GMs decide when a player has exceeded their action budget for the turn, cutting the string of skill checks short.

Some checks require less effort than others, and some do not count against the action budget. Other actions consume more than one action in the budget, such as attacks, or careful movement. Talking and general communication do not usually count against the action budget.

Once the Player has finished describing their actions, the GM dictates what skills to roll, and what level difficulty the rolls will be. Players do not get to change their minds once the actions have been rolled unless the GM presents them the option. Failing Skill checks mid action changes the nature of the turn spent, but the general momentum of the turn is maintained.
