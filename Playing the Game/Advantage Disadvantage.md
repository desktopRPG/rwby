# Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantage and Disadvantage are terms to describe further modifiers to the players’ dice. Advantage describes anything that would give the Character the upper hand. High ground and surprise are examples of Advantage. When Advantage is applied, a player rolls their dice, and before success or failure is determined, can roll their lowest die and take the better result. Anytime the character is at a disadvantage, such as darkness or being attacked by unknown assailants, Disadvantage is applied. Disadvantage is equal and opposite of Advantage, the players take their highest die and re-roll it, taking the worse result Advantage and Disadvantage are used to note slight variables, as some variables are significant enough to merit an entirely new tier of check. This tool can prove useful for GM’s looking to give players little modifiers without giving a full level of RoC.
