# Crafting Semblance Rolls

Semblances present a unique challenge to GMs, given that their variety is truly infinite. Many Semblances will be player created, and encompass a wide array of possible abilities that fall within its sphere of influence.

Crafting a Semblance roll follows the same “10, +5 per level of complexity” as any other skill check. Some complexities are simple increases such as increased range or multiple selected targets but more exotic complexities are more common, and more numerous but can follow a similar path.

Take, for example, Telekinesis. A character wants to telekinetically take a stone from one place and gently move it to another location relatively close by. This is about as pure as the Semblance can become so it is associated with a level of 10. If the character wanted to instead throw the stone at speed, it would be an additional level of complexity, bringing the total to 15. If the character wanted to throw the stone a great distance, it would be 20, or if the stone were a boulder of significant weight, the check could increase to 25. Any of these modifiers add 5, and do not need to be added in any order. GMs have the ultimate power. Some will have very hard semblances, some will have very easy semblances. Some GMs would decide the ability to levitate with Telekinesis has a difficulty of 15, others set the difficulty to 20. Neither are wrong, but the key is consistency.

Characters who want to use the Semblance to directly attack an enemy, the threshold is always at least equal to the enemy’s defense.
