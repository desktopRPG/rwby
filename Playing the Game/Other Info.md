# Elemental Semblances
A simple way to generate a Semblance is to use one of the existing elements that Dust normally gives Characters influence over. The key difference in using a Semblance to control an element rather than Dust is they are controlled with WIL rather than DIS. Dust however uses a renewable resource, but requires that the character be holding a weapon and devote a much higher DIS attribute to get the same returns.

# Attribute Enhancers
Some of the most straightforward Semblances are Attribute enhancers. Attribute Enhancing Semblances focus on a single attribute that defines the character. Semblance Checks allow the character to attempt a Skill Check normally defined by that Attribute, utilizing WIL as the primary and their focused attribute as the secondary. Skill checks attempted in this way should be one threshold easier to achieve than the normal Skill Check. In all other ways, this functions as a normal Semblance Check.

# Healing Semblances
Semblances that give direct control over character health and aura regeneration are inherently unbalanced and usually too clunky to make work in any fashion. There is simply not a large enough economy of mechanics in the Unofficial RWBY Tabletop RPG to allow for one character to nullify damage with little to no investment. Players looking to have a Healing Semblance are directed toward the Aura Healing combat maneuver on page 25.

# Flavor Text and Functionally Identical
Two important rules of thumb for any GM are the concepts of “Flavor Text” and “Functionally Identical”. Specifically during character creation, these concepts can allow players to craft their play to their desires without affecting the game. Flavor text is any descriptors that are there to simply add flare to an action or a character, and should always be free. Describing in detail how the sheath of the sword folds out into a shield or the character possessing a fully function prosthetic arm do not significantly influence play, and are excellent examples of Flavor Text. A character who wants to wield a high rate of fire minigun and have it reflected in the mechanics may choose to make a weapon functionally identical to having additional weapon multiple times instead of building an entirely new weapon modification.

To use an example this system has already implemented the concept, is the functionality of Stun Rounds. The Flavor Text of Stun Rounds are that the target is paralyzed and cannot move on its own, however the functional description of the effect is Held, identical to Freeze Crystals, rather than generating an entirely new status effect of “Paralyzed”. The flavor text of these two Dust forms is wildly different, but are functionally identical. The two concepts are very similar, but are both designed to give players much higher agency over their characters without increasing the workload on the GM.

# Player Versus Player
Sometimes players want to test themselves against each other. There are two ways to run player combat, Balanced and Unbalanced. In Balanced Combat, RoC is homogenized for all sides, and is the same for everyone. In Unbalanced Combat, each player (or team) has their own RoC score, and must compete to keep from falling Behind.

A key change to both types is turn order is held in descending order of WIL score, in the event of a tie use PER, and if the result is still the same, use AGI Any further conflict in turn order is determined by dice roll.

When players attack, they roll the relevant offensive attributes and the defending player makes a defense roll as normal. The higher number succeeding, with ties going to defender. All checks between players are opposed rolls, extending from attacks to Semblance and Dust uses.

In Unbalanced Combat, Natural Rolls of 20 and 2 do not modify RoC.

Sanctioned matches are usually fought to 1 Aura, but there are other “official” rules such as, Aura Break (Aura reaches 0), First Blood (Health takes 1 point of Damage), and KO(Health reaches 0). In all other ways combat functions normally.

# Monster Versus Monster
When two entities that would normally be controlled by the GM come in conflict, a simple format can be used to determine the winner. The two monsters have their health compared, the health of the weaker monster is deducted from both monsters’ health, killing the weaker monster. This effect happens over a number of turns equal to the weaker monster’s damage value. Multiple monsters acting in sync are crafted into a singular entity by adding their health together, otherwise they function as above.

When a Rival faces any other type of Enemy, the Enemy’s threat level is treated as it’s health, otherwise everything functions as normal.
