# Vehicles

Most Characters will encounter vehicles at some point in their careers. Different vehicles have different attributes required to successfully pilot Them, as well as: speed, health, and means of attack if any exist. Vehicles with integrated weapons do not take a damage penalty for not being a Character’s signature weapon, but actions such as ramming do. Attempting an action that is above normal operation such as hard turns as full speed, ramps, or evasive maneuvers requires making a check.

### Atlesian Paladin
The newest addition to Atlas’ defense force, used when a more human touch is still required in an otherwise android dominated space. The Atlesian Paladin houses a single pilot, and stands over 15ft tall. It is surprisingly nimble for its size, and often ignores any obstacles placed in its way. Given the nature of the Paladin, characters assume it’s physical attributes rather than use their own, but must succeed a Pilot PER+DIS check of 25 to be able to use it. The paladin has no aura, and Characters usually cannot make Semblance or Dust checks while inside.  
When piloting a Paladin, a Character is treated as uniquely being 1 RoC higher than normal.
