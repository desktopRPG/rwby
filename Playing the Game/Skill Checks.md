# Skill Checks

A single obstacle can be overcome in any number of ways. How a character attempts to bypass it determines the skill check used. For example, a team of Characters is presented with a locked door. Breaking down the door is a STR+END check, picking the lock is a AGI+PER check and trying to break the lock or hinges is a STR+DIS, while trying to shoot them would be a AGI+DIS. When a task can reasonably be accomplished by more than two attributes, it is a judgment call on the GM to decide which two attributes contribute the most to the given skill.

Skill Checks are a combination of two base attributes, using their ranking as a modifier to add to the character’s d10 rolls. There are 15 total combinations of attributes, but countless number of actions that a character can make.

The following skill checks are examples of each of the 15 checks, but ultimately the two most relevant checks are what are used in any given moment regardless of this list.

Some checks can be attempted again on failure. Some, however, cannot until a change occurs allowing a retry. Most physical checks, like acrobatics, can be retried on failure. Something like a Detection check cannot be retried, at least not until a change occurs such as new terrain, additional sets of eyes, or simply waiting.

### Skill Thresholds

GMs apply the logic of the world and quantify it as tiers of difficulty for players to roll against. Thresholds come in increments of 5. The exact difficulty of a threshold can be withheld from a player if they do not have adequate information, such as making a leap of faith in the dark.

Sometimes, players may perceive a given task at a higher or lower threshold than is actually true, if the information they have on the obstacle is inaccurate, such as leaping onto illusionary terrain. At its most basic level, difficulty thresholds on skill checks can be determined with a simple “10+5 per complexity” system. In essence this means that taking the most basic concept of the skill and associate it with a difficulty of 10. For every level that character’s attempt to modify that skill, add 5 to the given check.

For example, a character who wants to hide from an unaware enemy is a 10 Stealth Check. If that enemy is on active watch or the character wants to move while sneaking, the check is 15 for one modifier, or 20 for both.

In cases where multiple modifiers do not adequately describe the task at hand, a simple “easy-medium-hard,” scale will suffice. Without RoC, 10 is easy, 15 is medium, and 20 is hard. 25 is the gate between abilities that can be achieved through normal human endeavor, and the realm of the impossible such as hiding when actively being watched, lifting a vehicle to its side with bare hands, or leaping over a 25ft chasm.

Some checks can be determined with a simple formula. This is most common on checks associated with distance like Acrobatics or Dust checks. Ultimately, this method works best for any check with a gradient of outcomes, rather than a binary pass-fail.

**10: Simple**- Beyond everyday action, but easy enough even for the unskilled. A test to “not fail”.  
**15: Average**- Impressive to normal civilians, but par for the course for Huntsmen and Huntresses.  
**20: Challenging**- Can only be accomplished by a normal human with a lifetime of training, natural talent, and luck.  
**25: Amazing**- Feats well beyond the normal human, usually associated with popular culture action heroes.  
**30: Superhuman**- Reserved for the very experienced Huntsmen and those with literal super powers.  
**35: Legendary**- Accomplishments that can last forever as rumor or myth.  
**40: Impossible**- The very fabric of reality moves aside for the Huntsman. Even laws of nature stand in the way, but the Huntsman that accomplishes this task pays no heed.
