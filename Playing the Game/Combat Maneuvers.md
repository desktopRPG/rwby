# Combat Maneuvers

**Attacks and Semblances**  
Characters may perform 1 attack or Semblance use per action, but not more than 2 such actions per turn. An “attack” is any action where the only intended result is direct damage to an entity. Semblances and Attacks pull from the same pool of two actions per turn. Attacks made with Dust phials consume both of these actions.

**Movement**  
Movement is 15ft per action, but if the Character spends their whole budget running, the character can move 50ft.

**Reload**  
Reloading Capacity is 1 action. When reloading, a Character may declare 1 color of Dust they possess.

**Unarmed Attacks**  
Unarmed attacks are STR+END rolls that deal half damage.

**Capacity Boost**  
Characters can consume one capacity to improve an non-attack skill check by 1 point. Typically movement based checks such as lift or acrobatics can be boosted, but so can non-physical checks such as Intimidation. Characters can also use a Capacity boost in conjunction with standard movement, or a ranged attack, in which case they immediately move 5ft in a given direction (directly away from their target in the case of a ranged attack). Which skill checks can be boosted vary on the situation, and their relevance is determined by the GM.

**Suppressing Fire**  
Consume a point of capacity to suppress an enemy in cover. Designate a specific enemy or piece of cover, and automatically roll attack against them if they move into a targetable position.

**Non-Lethal Attacks**  
Enemies can be knocked unconscious by bringing their Health to 0 exactly with lethal attacks. Non-Lethal attacks can be used to bring the target’s Health to 0 without overkill, losing any remainder. To perform a Non-Lethal attack, a Character may take disadvantage on the attack and cut all damage in half, and any bonus damage for beating defenses is lost.

**Additional Weapon Attacks**  
Additional Weapon allows Characters who spends any part of their turn making any normal attack, may make an additional attack using a single relevant attribute. Additional Melee attacks only roll STR, and additional Ranged attacks only roll AGI.

**Charge Attack**  
Characters can spend their entire action budget and their remaining Capacity, up to 5, on a single well aimed charged attack to hit targets that would otherwise be beyond their capability. Characters to make an charge attack increase their attack roll by the amount of capacity consumed. Charge attacks can be melee or ranged attacks. Ranged Charge attacks consume 1 additional capacity without additional benefit as a normal ranged attack would.

**Execute**  
Consume full action budget to Instantly kill a helpless target.

**Grapple**  
Characters roll a STR+PER Grapple check against an adjacent opponent. Human sized opponents are held in place, while massive opponents are held onto, with higher levels of RoC being able to treat enemies as smaller than they actually are. Characters with Hooked weapons may roll their melee attack attributes instead of STR+PER, and any reach the weapon has also applies.

**Aura Healing**  
Characters may spend a full action budget to increase an ally’s Health through touch. The Character spends 2 points of Aura for every point of Health recovered. This awakens unconscious Characters, and also removes any status effects. This effect cannot be used to increase Aura, and Characters cannot use this on themselves. Characters may attempt to perform this feat over distances, using a WIL+PER Aura check equal to the number of feet away their target is. Characters can also perform this feat rapidly, and must roll WIL+PER 20 for it to only consume 2 actions of the turn, and WIL+PER 30 for it to consume 1. The two modifiers of distance and time are added together if used at the same time.

**Sneak Attacks**  
Characters cannot miss when attacking an unaware target with a melee weapon. Characters are guaranteed a successful attack regardless of how low the attack roll, including on missed Targeted Strikes. However missing the necessary threshold for a Targeted Strike results in normal damage and no status effect. Attack rolls of a Natural 2 still miss and critically fail. Only applies to the first melee attack while hidden to target.

**Throwing a Weapon**  
Characters can roll a melee attack against a target at range. The maximum distance to the target cannot exceed the character’s accuracy roll in feet, and no STR damage is added to successful attacks. The Character’s weapon is dropped at target’s feet. Characters can use the Green Dust Crystal to double this range limitation and return the weapon to their hand.

**Targeted Strikes**  
Declare a specific body part of the intended target. The Target’s defenses are increased by the amount specified. Missing this threshold results in a miss, even if the strike would hit the target’s standard defense. Successfully hitting this threshold results in a status effect on target depending on selected body part. Base damage and bonus damage from RoC or Dust are applied, but passive bonus damage from bypassing defense is not.
