# Turn Phases

Combat is held in a series of phases. Characters conduct their turn during the phase corresponding to their WIL score. Characters with a high WIL score lack hesitation in the face of the unknown, and more naturally take the initiative in dangerous situation.

Characters with higher WIL scores act before characters with low WIL scores. Characters with the same WIL occupy the same phase, and can act individually or simultaneously. Acting individually is functionally identical to normal turn order, only the participants may chose to swap places at any time. Acting simultaneously requires weaving actions between two or more characters until their respective action budgets have been filled.

Characters may also hold their turn until they see fit to act in a different turn phase. If a Character holds their turn for the full round until their phase again, their held action is lost and their new turn begins. Enemies always act between phases, but characters holding their action may interrupt an enemy “between” the Phases. Enemies can hold their turn as well, but this is mostly limited to intelligent entities.
