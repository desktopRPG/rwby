# Status Effects

Status effects are anything that hinders the target in some way beyond damage. Most Status effects are applied by targeting an enemyâ€™s weak points, or through the use of Dust.

When Characters are affected by Status effects, the effect lasts a number of turns equal to the amount of damage received from the hazard or attack that caused the status effect. Any status effects applied without a direct damaging effect last 1 turn.

Status Effects do not stack on the same target more than once, but different status effects can be applied to the same target.

Status Effects that affect Attack and Defense Thresholds only affect the lowest threshold. Bonuses like Bonus Damage, Maximize damage and Counter attacks retain their normal thresholds.
